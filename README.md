Go tasks:
1. Hello world
2. HTTP Server (an API ”/hello“ that returns 'hello world')
3. HTTP Client（requests "/hello" from the HTTP server and prints the result to the command line)
4. Package the Go server and client programs as two binaries, run directly (without using 'go run'), to achieve client requesting the server and printing the result.
5. Package the server and client from the above into two Docker images respectively, run the server and the client to obtain the result.
